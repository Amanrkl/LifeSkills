### **Question 1**

What is Deep Work?

Deep Work is a term coined by Cal Newport, to describe the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It is a state of intense concentration that can produce great results, especially in knowledge work, such as programming, writing, or problem-solving. To achieve Deep Work, one must clear away distractions, set goals and priorities, and practice maintaining focus for long periods of time.

### **Question 2**

Paraphrase all the ideas in the above videos and this one in detail.

The optimal duration for deep work is about 60- 90 mins to be effective.

Deadlines are good as one can schedule his time for work and break effectively to meet the deadline requirements.

Here are a few examples of Deep Work:

While writing the Harry Potter books, JK Rowling's only tweet for the first year and a half after joining Twitter was: “This is the real me, but you won’t be hearing from me often I am afraid, as pen and paper is my priority at the moment.”

CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself in a lakeside cottage to do nothing but read and think big thoughts. One think week led to the famous “Internet Tidal Wave” memo which led to the development of Microsoft’s powerful web browser.

If one wants to develop skills and produce work that the world considers rare and valuable, he/she needs to develop a daily deep work ritual.

4 Deep Work Ritual Requirements:

- Dedicated workspace - The ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
- Exact end time - By establishing a clear end time for each deep work session, you give yourself permission to focus intensely and experience discomfort because you know exactly when the discomfort will end.
- Easy starting sequence - The ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. Without this structure, you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions.
- Power‐ups - Th ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear.
