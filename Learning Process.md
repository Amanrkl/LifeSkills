### **Feynman Technique:**

The Feynman Technique is a method using which  one can learn and understand any concept. It is named after the physicist Richard Feynman. 

The technique consists of four steps:

- Always have a heading name to the topic which helps to learn things in structure way. The topic should break down to further subtopics.
- explain the topic to someone else in simple language using simple terms, examples and diagrams.
- By doing this, one identifies the subarea in which his concept is not clear. Then review the source notes, materials for that subarea until it is not completely understood.
- Mark any difficult terms and try to simplify them in easy to understand way.

The goal is to be able to explain the topic such that someone who is not an expert on the topic can understand. This can help  to better understand the topic oneself, as well as communicate it more effectively to others.

### **Different ways to implement Feynman technique in the learning process:**

- While revising any topic,  explain it to myself in mind or writing rough notes. This helps to know the subarea i can’t recall and relearn that myself or ask mentor
- Try explaining the concept to someone who knows nothing about it. This can help to see the topic from a different perspective.
- Can teach the concept to colleague, using simple language and examples. He can ask doubts or questions my explanation which will help as feedback for me. If our understanding differs then can clarify the mistake in each other understanding.

### Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley

One can learn new things at any stage of life. For example, though not having mathematics background, Barbara Oakley after her different ventures got curious on engineering and learn the stuff. She became a professor in engineering field.

It is crucial to learn techniques for how to learn effectively. First understand how the brain functions when one try to learn. The brain is very complex but we can break its operations into two fundamental different modes. They are as following:

- Focus mode - attentive state in which we are concentrating with focus on the concept. We can find familiarity with the topic in this state.
- Diffused mode - relax state in which our mind wanders to different thoughts. This state can help to get new perspectives in our thinking which further help us to combine with the concept we are trying to learn.

When we learn , we go back and forth from one mode to another. We can’t be in a mode continuously. With pinball machine analogy, we can understand the two modes. In familiar path, the mind states in focus mode but to reach new area, we can switch to diffused mode which can move in random way to the targeted area. This technique is used by great personalities like Salvador Dali who was in creative field and Thomas Edison who was in engineering field.

Biggest obstacle for this technique is procrastination. While procrastinating, one look at something which he would rather not do, there is actual physical pain felt by the brain. One can handle it in two ways. Firstly, he can keep working through it and procrastination will fade away. Secondly, using Pomodoro technique in which timer for a fixed time say 25 minutes. In that time, one should be attentive with no distraction and focus on task he wants to do. Then have 5 minutes break to relax and do something fun.

Different people have various different traits like one who has poor working memory would be more creative person as his mind goes from one thought to another. People have different speed of grasping information and knowledge. A person can be like a racer who can process faster or like a hiker who through slow will have different experience. Slow thinking explains that the person who process slowly will have solid materialize the knowledge.

Illusion of competence in learning refers to tendency for people to overestimate their own knowledge and abilities even though have given sufficient time. This can lead individuals to have test anxiety  which means they did not really understand a topic or concept better and feel anxious.

Studies have shown exercises helps a person in learning effectively. Exercises can increase our ability to learn and remember. Another useful ways to learn effectively is to using tests. One can test his learning using mini tests, flash cards and homework. One should not do homework problem in a single go rather let solution flow through your mind which helps in more clarity in concepts. Recall is a another way to study effectively. Instead of highlighting or reread, try to recall without seeing the page. This way creates neural hooks in brain. At last, understanding is not alone mastery of a concept. Understanding with practices and repetitions in different circumstances truly create mastery on what one is learning.

In conclusion, everyone should learn how to learn effectively. One should not blindly follow passion rather broaden his passion. This way, one could have a life full of enrichment.

### **Some of the steps  to improve the learning process:**

- Working in time slots with small break like Pomodoro technique to complete certain well defined tasks.
- Remove all distractions like social media, and keep phone in silent.
- Regular exercises would be helpful in keeping mind and body healthy which further helps in our work.
- Learn a concept by reading from different sources, practice by trying hands on and revise often.

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours

### Key takeaways:

One should always find free time in his schedule to learn skills. It has been suggested in 10,000 rule that in order to become an expert in a particular field, one must practice the relevant skills for a total of 10,000 hours. It might be true for highly competitive fields which requires very high performance but to learn new skills, the first 20 hours are crucial.

The steps  to learn anything are as follows:

- Deconstruct the skill - Decide what exactly one wants to do, then break the skills required into smaller sub skills. Focus on most important sub skills first to improve in least time.
- Learn enough to self correct - don’t have too many sources to learn which may make you to procrastinate. Rather learn just enough to practice those skills and self correct with practice.
- Remove practice barriers - distractions like television, internet, social media which get in your work remove those.
- Practice first 20 hours - in first 20 hours, doing the skills helps to overcome initial frustration barrier
- 

### **Some of the steps to  approach a new topic:**

- Break down the new topics into smaller sub topics and then first try to learn the important ones among them.
- Don’t learn from many sources which will burden you. Rather learn few topics first and practice on those concepts to remove doubts and get more clarity.
- Remove distractions by keeping your phone on silent, keeping only notifications for work-related apps.
- In initial 20 hours, stick to the learn to get familiar with the topics.
