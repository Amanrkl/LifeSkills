# **Listening and Active Communication**

### **1. Active Listening**

**Steps/Strategies to do Active Listening-**

- Avoid getting distracted by one’s own thoughts, instead, focus on the speaker and the topic
- Try not to interrupt the other person in between the conversation, let them finish first then respond
- Use door openers such as tell me more, that sounds interesting to show another person your interest in the conversation
- Use body language to show one is listening
- Take notes in an important conversation
- paraphrase to show both are on the same page

### **2. Reflective Listening**
**The critical points of Reflective Listening according to Fisher's model-**

1. Paying full attention to the speaker: This means setting aside any distractions and fully focusing on the person who is speaking.
2. Listening for understanding: Rather than simply hearing the words that the speaker is saying, try to fully understand their perspective, feelings, and needs.
3. Reflecting back to the speaker: Once one has a good understanding of what the speaker is saying, reflect back to them his understanding of their thoughts and feelings. This can help confirm that you have accurately understood them and help the speaker feel heard and understood.
4. Asking clarifying questions: If unsure about something the speaker has said, ask clarifying questions to ensure that one has a full and accurate understanding of their perspective.

- Passive Aggressive Communication
- Assertive Communication

**When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?**

When someone asks for help while I am working on an important task, I behave passively and couldn’t say no to him at that moment.

**When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?**

I sometimes lose my patience when I am trying to explain something and the other person is not responding properly 

**When do you switch to Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?**

When I don't want to continue a conversation, I want to leave it.

**How can you make your communication assertive?** 

- Try to show my feelings including discomforting ones to others in a conversation
- By being direct and clear about my message.
- Seek to find common ground and come to a mutually beneficial solution when possible.
- Use respectful tone and language, even when disagreeing or expressing a differing opinion.
- Stand up for my beliefs, while also being open to hearing the perspectives of others.
- By using body language and nonverbal cues to reinforce my message, such as maintaining eye contact.
- Practice active listening, which means paying attention to and fully understanding the message of the other person.
