### **Question 1**

Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines. 

Studying different fields of tasks to determine characteristics for success, shows that neither social intelligence, talent, IQ, good look nor physical health but the characteristic that emerged as the significant predictor of success from the study is grit.  

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. It is like having the stamina to stick with the future every day. Grit is living life as a marathon, not a sprint.

Studies have shown that it is not necessary to be talented for being gritty. There is not much correlation between them. Growth mindset is found useful to build grit as shown by Carol Dweck’s studies. It is believed that ability to learn is not fixed but can change with effort. Gritty people treat failure as a temporary condition.

### **Question 2**

What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?

The popular conception is that to be successful in life, one should have a high IQ, be talented, or good physique is not entirely true. By being gritty, one can achieve anything in his life.

One should have a growth mindset and not see failure as a setback but as a stepping stone in achieving long-term goals.

Try to stick with the future and show up to work every day.

Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines.

Growth Mindset is 

- To believe in one’s capacity to learn and grow
- A concept that has a great impact on the field of sports and education and changes the way we learn

For decades, Carol Dweck has studied why some people succeed, while some people who are equally talented do not, and found people’s mindset plays a crucial role in this process.

There are two types of mindset people have:

Fixed mindset-

- People with this mindset believe that skills and intelligence are fixed and can't change in a lifetime. They believe that one has no control over his abilities.
- Focus more on performance and outcomes. Concern more on to not look bad.
- effort- not necessary, not useful
- challenges- back down and avoid
- mistakes- hate them, get discouraged and avoid them
- feedback- think not helpful, get defensive, take it personal

Growth mindset-

- They believe that skills and intelligence are grown and developed. One does have control over his abilities.
- Focus more on the process of learning and getting better
- effort- useful leads to growth
- challenges-embraces and persevere, frame as an opportunity
- mistakes- use them to learn
- feedback- appreciate and use it

Growth mindset is the foundation for learning.

## 3. **Understanding the Internal Locus of Control**

How to stay motivated Video - The Locus Rule - 5:47 minutes - [The Locus Rule ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZhoeSaPF-k)

### **Question 5**

What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

Locus of control refers to the degree to which individuals believe that they can control the outcomes of events in their lives. People with an internal locus of control believe that they have the ability to control their own lives and attribute their successes and failures to their own actions and efforts. On the other hand, people with an external locus of control tend to attribute the outcomes of events to external factors, such as luck or the actions of others.

Research has shown that people with an internal locus of control tend to be more self-motivated and have higher self-esteem, while those with an external locus of control may be more prone to anxiety and helplessness. It is important to note that locus of control is not a fixed trait and can vary depending on the situation.

One can have self-motivation by having the internal locus of control that his own actions and efforts can change the outcomes in his life.
