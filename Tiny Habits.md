### **Question 1**

Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

Behavior can change in fifteen different ways.

One can change long-term behavior by changing the environment including social environment and tiny habits.

Focus on behavior like tiny habits leading to desired outcomes rather directly on outcomes.

Three things essential for behavior change is the level of motivation, the ability to do, and a trigger. 

One can have a small way to celebrate after the completion of a task that he is trying to develop as a habit.

Linking the new habit with an existing regular habit, for example - After I use the washroom, I will do 2 pushups.

### **Question 2**

Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible

The universal behavior model consists of motivation, ability, and prompt.

The tiny habits method  can be described in three parts:

- Shrink the behavior -  either by reducing the quantity or just doing the first step, for example - to do a workout, start with a single pushup
- Identify an action prompt - Prompts can be external, internal, and action. Both external and internal prompts can be ignored easily and can be demotivating. Action prompts are effective. Example- After I sit down on the train, I will open my novel.
- Grow your habit with some shine-  have a celebration ritual after completing a tiny habit that helps in success momentum

### **Question 3**

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

This can be done by setting reminders, creating a routine, and making the behavior more convenient to perform. Additionally, by focusing on increasing personal ability through education, practice, and setting small, achievable goals, one can increase their confidence and motivation to perform the desired behavior.

For example, if developing a new habit (like reading a book every night before bed), one will perform the habit if his motivation (desire to read) matches the ability required to read (access to a book and time needed to hit his daily reading goal) the moment he receives a prompt to read (get a reminder on his phone or see a book on his nightstand).

### **Question 4**

Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

When you give yourself a steady dose of Shine after doing the tiniest version of a habit, your motivation will steadily grow. When your motivation increases, you move higher up the “action line” and can tackle harder habits. Soon your one‐breath‐meditation turns into a 5‐minute meditation and eventually a 60‐minute meditation you look forward to every day.

Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

- There are four stages of Habit Formation
    - Noticing
    - Wanting
    - Doing
    - Liking
- You can't take an action if you don't notice something
    - Implementation of Action
        - Have a plan to implement the behavior you want to change
        - Have clarity, and motivation without clarity of plan don’t start anything
- If you notice something, you should be 'wanting' to take an action on it
    - Design your environment to drive you towards achieving your habit
    - Make bad habits harder to achieve and good habits easier to achieve
- Learning how to start new activity is important
    - Two-minute rule:
        - If it takes two minutes, do it now
        - Any habit can be started in less than two minutes
        - Optimize at the beginning of the task
    - Best way to change long term behaviour is with short term feedback
    - Don't break the chain and never miss twice
- Like and enjoy what you do

Video - 11:11 minutes - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7tQzmGRLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7tQzmGRLA)

### **Question 6**

Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes, and outcomes.

Habit formation can be broken down into three main components: identity, processes, and outcomes.
Identity refers to the person or type of person we believe ourselves to be. According to Clear, our habits are a reflection of our identity, and the key to forming good habits is to become the type of person who has those habits.
Processes refer to the specific actions and behaviors that make up a habit. Clear argues that it is important to focus on the process of forming a habit, rather than the outcome because the outcome is often beyond our control.
Outcomes refer to the results or effects of our habits. Clear suggests that it is important to measure and track the outcomes of our habits in order to understand the impact they are having on our lives.

### **Question 7**

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

- Focus on making small, incremental changes to behavior, making the new habit "atomic"
- Use "habit stacking" to attach a new habit to an existing habit that is already a part of the daily routine
- Create an environment that supports the habit by removing obstacles and adding cues
- Use a system of rewards and penalties to incentivize maintaining the habit
- Be patient, knowing that it takes time to build a habit and every day is an opportunity to work on it and make it better.
- Make the habit easy to start, make it obvious, make it attractive, make it satisfying and make it consistent.

### **Question 8**

Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult.

- Identify the cues, rewards and the belief that is driving the bad habit, and actively work to change them.
- Create an environment that makes it difficult to engage in the bad habit by removing cues, making it less attractive, and increasing the difficulty.
- Use an "inversion" mindset, where instead of focusing on what you want to do, focus on what you don't want to do.
- Use a system of rewards and penalties to incentivize not engaging in the bad habit.
- Be patient, knowing that it takes time to break a habit and every day is an opportunity to work on it and make it better.
- Make the habit difficult to start, make it invisible, make it unattractive, make it unsatisfying and make it inconsistent.
- Use accountability, such as telling someone about your plan to break the bad habit, can help increase the chances of success.

## **5. Reflection:**

### **Question 9:**

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I would like to develop the habit of following a healthy diet.

some steps that  can take to make eating healthy food more attractive, easy, and satisfying:

- Plan ahead: Take some time each week to plan out healthy meals and snacks for the upcoming days. Having a plan in place will make it easier to make healthy choices when hunger strikes.
- Keep healthy foods visible and convenient: Keep healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts, in plain sight in the kitchen.
- Get creative in the kitchen: Try new recipes and experiment with different herbs, spices, and cooking methods to make healthy foods more interesting and appealing.
- Reward me: Treat me to something special, such as a piece of dark chocolate or relaxing activity, after eating a healthy meal or snack.
- Find a healthy eating buddy: Having a friend or family member to share healthy meals and snacks with can make the experience more enjoyable and satisfying.
- Keep track of progress.

### **Question 10:**

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to quit social media usage in my everyday life. The following steps I can think of:

- Identify the triggers: Understand what triggers for using social media and make a plan to avoid those triggers.
- Make it invisible: Remove social media apps from my phone.
- Make it unattractive: Remove notifications and turn off sounds, vibrations, and badges associated with social media apps.
- Make it hard: Use an app or browser extension that blocks social media sites.
- Find alternatives: Identify activities that you enjoy, such as reading, exercising, or spending time with friends and family, and make sure you have time for these activities instead of using social media.
