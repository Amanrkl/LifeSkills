### Question 4

Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail.

Sleep is a superpower because it has the ability to restore and rejuvenate the body and mind. Studies have shown that lack of sleep impacts the reproductive hormones and health in both men and women which leads to early aging. Sleep is required both before and after learning to be effective. People with sleep deprivation have been shown 40% less effective in learning than people with proper sleep. Similar results have been found for brain activity.

During deep sleep, there are enhanced brain waves that help to transfer memory from short-term sites to more permanent sites of the brain. With aging, deep sleep gets worse which may lead to worse memory. Avoid sleep pills as they don't help in natural deep sleep. Lack of sleep also impacts cardiovascular activities which may lead to a higher chance of heart attack and a reduction in natural killer cells in the body impacting the immune system.

One can have better sleep by regularity i.e go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time every day. Keep the bedroom temperature cool for optimal sleep.

### Question 5

What are some ideas that you can implement to sleep better?

- Establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including on weekends.
- Create a relaxing bedtime routine to help you wind down and get ready for sleep. This can include activities like reading, listening to soothing music, or taking a warm bath.
- Make your bedroom a comfortable and sleep-friendly environment. Keep the room at a cool, comfortable temperature, and consider using a white noise machine or earplugs to block out any distractions.
- Avoid stimulating activities before bed, such as watching TV, working on the computer, or engaging in intense physical activity.

### Question 6

Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise.

There is a significant body of research that suggests that regular exercise has a number of brain-boosting benefits. Some of the ways in which exercise may benefit the brain include:

1. Improving memory and cognitive function: Some studies have shown that regular aerobic exercise can improve memory and cognitive function in both younger and older adults. A person reaction time is also enhanced by regular exercise.
2. Better energy and long-term memory: Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which may help to nourish brain cells and improve overall brain function.
3. Reducing stress and anxiety: Exercise has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins and other feel-good chemicals in the brain.
4. Promoting brain plasticity: Exercise may promote brain plasticity by stimulating the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that helps to support the growth and survival of brain cells.
5. Enhancing mood: Regular physical activity has been shown to improve mood and reduce the risk of depression.

### Question 7

What are some steps you can take to exercise more?

- Set a goal: Start by setting a specific, achievable goal for yourself, such as "I will walk for 30 minutes every day this week,". Having a clear goal in mind will help to keep you motivated and on track.
- Start small: If you're new to exercise, or if you've been inactive for a while, start with shorter, lower-intensity workouts and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you become more comfortable.
- Find an activity you enjoy: Choose an activity that you enjoy, whether it's going for a walk, swimming, dancing, or playing a sport. This will make it more likely that you'll stick with it in the long run.
- Stay consistent: To see the greatest benefits, aim to exercise on a regular basis, rather than trying to fit it all in at once. Try to find a time of day that works best for you and make it a habit.
- Be patient: Remember that it takes time to see the benefits of exercise, and it's normal to have ups and downs along the way. Stay consistent, and don't get discouraged if you don't see results right away.
